Gadget Couturier program: CS101 Project
The Gadget Couturier is a program that scrapes data from Flipkart, filters the data based on user specifications and displays it in a tabular format alongwith
an analysis chart and a scatter plot to compare the price and ratings
The program was originally developed to scrape three different categories of products, i.e, Gaming Laptops, Casual Laptops and Mobile Phones. However the project
may be extended to cover other products as well
